- [todo] [feat] [high] Add option for breadth-first or depth-first approach for conductor agent. In the first one, the agent will keep on launching new agents until everything is past the 1st phase. Example: pick until there's nothing else to turn into a PRD. Then plan until there are no more PRDs to plan. and so on. In the second one, the agent will pick a task, then plan it then refine it then implement it. Unless it's blocked in which case it will pick another one, then plan, then refine. and so on.
- [todo] [feat] [low] Add a task limit. Sth additional to the number of iterations. For example if I launch the picker, let's only pick 10 tasks.
